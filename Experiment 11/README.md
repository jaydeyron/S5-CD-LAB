# Three Address Code to Target Code Converter

## Problem Statement
Implement back end of the compiler which takes 3 address code and produce the target code

## Components

### 1. Main Function
- Prompts the user to enter the number of three address code statements.
- Accepts the three address code statements from the user.
- Converts each three address code statement into target code instructions.
- Prints the target code instructions.

## How to Use
1. Compile the code using a C compiler (e.g., `gcc -o taddr_to_target taddr_to_target.c`).
2. Run the compiled program (e.g., `./taddr_to_target`).
3. Enter the number of three address code statements when prompted.
4. Enter each three address code statement when prompted.
5. View the generated target code instructions.

## Note
- Ensure that the code accurately converts three address code statements to target code instructions.
- Make necessary adjustments to the code as per specific requirements or to accommodate additional features.
